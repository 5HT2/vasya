## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. I'm not looking for help adding modules, I just never finished implementing brigadier so I didn't add a bind system. I'll gladly do everything myself as long as there's brigadier impl. A full todo list is on the website.

0. `git clone git@github.com:dominikaaaa/vasya.git`

1. Import the `build.gradle` file with IntelliJ IDEA

2. File > Close Project, then reopen the project (needed to properly import run configurations)

3. You can now hit the green play button in the upper left of IntelliJ
